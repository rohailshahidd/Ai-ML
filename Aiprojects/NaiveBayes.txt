**How to run**

->Open on google colab as the project was done on that platform
->Every thing is self explanatory with comments added and all you have to do is run the code chunks one by one in order.
->I took the small dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset, you can do so from here as well and run the project!
